;
; Rec Adder
; @@@@@@@@@
;    
; 0.    Assemble and run this program.
;
; 1.    Try to give the program different inputs, and observe the output.
;       Give some small numbers as input in the beginning.
;
; 2.    Read the program's code below, and try to understand what does it do. 
;       Try to describe it as simply as you can. Add comments if needed.
;
;       Take out a pen and a paper, and find out what happens to the stack
;       during this program.
;
; 3.    Explain the program's output.
;
;       The sum of two inputted numbers
;
; 4.    Try to give the program large numbers as input. What happens? Why?
;       Evaluate the size of the stack using this experiment.
;
;       Stack overflow (kaboom)
;
; NOTE: 
;       The technique employed in this code where a function calls itself is
;       called Recursion.
;
;       This example is very inefficient, but serves as an example for a
;       Recursive function.
