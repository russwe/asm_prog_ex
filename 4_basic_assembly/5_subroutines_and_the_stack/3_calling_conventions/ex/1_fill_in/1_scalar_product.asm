; Scalar product
; @@@@@@@@@@@@@@
;    
; 0.    Skim the code. Take a look at the functions and their descriptions.
;       Understand the dependencies between the functions (Which function calls
;       which function), and what is the special purpose of every function.
;
; 1.    Read the main code (Beginning from start), and see how the function
;       scalar_product is being called. Which calling convention is being used?
;
; 2.    Fill in the scalar_product function. This function calculates the scalar
;       product (Sometimes referred to as inner product) between two vectors.
;       See exact formula in the comments below.
;       
;       Note that you may only fill in the scalar_product function. Do not
;       change the rest of the code.
;       
;       Make sure that you deal with arguments and the stack according to the
;       correct calling convention. Think about the following:
;       - Who should clean the stack?
;       - Where should the return value be?
;       - Saving registers to the stack, so that your function will not have
;         side effects.
;
; 3.    Assemble and run the code. Verify the result that you get.
;
;       Just to be sure, check the value of esp before and after
;       the call to scalar_product, to verify that the stack is balanced.
